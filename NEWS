	Version 1.1: Added support for hige data item (> 4GB). Fixed a few bugs. One
	major bug fixed is move pages upon opening a file when the file has number
	of moved pages > 0 and this file is opened for write even if the rearrange page 
	flag is not set.
	Largest data item is not at 2^40. The largest page is 1MB (2^20).
